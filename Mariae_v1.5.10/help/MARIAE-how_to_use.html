                                activates the task model simulator, which enables you to
                                interactively simulate the behaviour of the currently loaded task
                                model. After you select this option, you will see the tasks that
                                are enabled at the beginning of the simulation (which have been
                                automatically derived according to the temporal relationships
                                specified in the task model). Then, you can select one of such
                                tasks (by double-clicking on it) and then the simulation will move
                                to the next state, which is the new state reached after executing
                                the task just selected. You can repeat this as many times as the
                                task model specification enables. Please note that, depending on
                                the task model at hand the simulation might even never stop (e.g.
                                this could occur when after a number of steps you reach again the
                                initial state of the simulation, or when the root of the task model
                                is iterative, ..).</li>
                            <li><em><strong><a name="Generate" id="Generate">Generate
                                            AUI</a></strong> - </em>This feature enables you to generate an
                                Abstract UI model from the currently loaded CTT task model. When
                                you activate such a functionality, the tool automatically
                                transforms the CTT task model into an AUI model, by applying some
                                default settings to carry out this step. </li>
                            <li><em><strong>Generate AUI from Presentation Task Sets..</strong> -
                                </em>Differently from the previous functionality in this case the
                                user has more control on the transformation that generates an AUI
                                model from a CTT task model. In particular, the user will be asked
                                to select a number of <em>heuristics</em> to be used during this
                                transformation. Such heuristics are typically aimed at reducing the
                                number of AUI presentations that will be generated in the end by
                                this transformation. If you do not want to bother with these
                                heuristics you can directly use the <a href="#Generate">Generate

                        a group of functionalities that can be applied to a CUI specification
                        for desktop platform (compliant with the <a
                            href="http://giove.isti.cnr.it/tools/MARIA/home">MARIA language</a>)
                        <ul>

                                this functionality to a currently loaded CUI specification for the

                            <li><em><strong>Generate Mobile CUI</strong> -</em> Differently from
                                the above three functionalities, this feature does not implement a
                                model-to-code transformation. Rather, it support a model-to-model
                                <em>semantic redesign</em> transformation. By applying this
                                transformation to a CUI desktop, you will obtain another CUI
                                specification semantically redesigned and adapted for the mobile
                                platform. This transformation uses some rules for performing this
                                adaptation (for instance some interactors are replaced by other
                                interactors more suitable for the mobile platform, a splitting step
                                might be carried out for supporting a a more effective pagination
                                of the original desktop presentations, ..)<em></em></li>

        <p>MARIAE is a tool for handling a number of multi-layer (task, abstract,
            concrete, implementation layer) UI descriptions of your interactive
            applications. Using MARIAE you will end up creating a number of UI models
            referring to the same scenario/example. For this reason, in order to easily
            handle the files referring to the same example/application/scenario, we
            provided you with the possibility to collect such models/files within the same
            <em>project</em>. Please note that MARIAE projects generally have a
            ".<em>meprj</em>" extension.</p>

				which defines 2 interfaces: Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis. <br/>
				The Speech Recognition interface is currently supported by Google Chrome v25 or later.<br/>
				The Speech Synthesis interface is, at this moment, under development and to exploit it users have to download the latest Google Chrome version 
				for develpers that it is named Google Chrome Canary and it is available at 
				<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html</a>.<br/>
				Google Chrome Canary has the newest of the new Chrome features, it's designed for developers and early adopters, and can sometimes break down completely.<br/>
				Because of the Speech Synthesis interface is under development users have to enable it from Chrome settings: 
				<ul>
					<li>Go to chrome://flags page</li>
					<li>Find the row 'Exprerimental Web Platform features'</li>
					<li>Enable this feature</li>
					<li>Restart the browser</li>
				</ul>
                Regarding the mobile platform the multimodal support is has been implemented only for Android devices: to open the new Multimodal HTML transformation users have to 
				download the HIIS Multimodal Application at <a href="http://giove.isti.cnr.it/tools/MultimodalHtml/home">http://giove.isti.cnr.it/tools/MultimodalHtml/home</a>
